# Use bottom up DP to track the minimum cost of painting each house with each color.
# For house i and color c add the min cost of painting house i-1 with a different color.
# Return the minimum cost of painting the last house with any of the three colors.

# Time Complexity: O(n)
# Space Complexity: O(1) â€” if done in-place on `costs`
